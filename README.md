# 3monkey

This is based on the three.js example [WebGL Instancing Dynamic](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=instancing#webgl_instancing_dynamic)

I wanted to learn how to modify many instances of the same mesh
and interact with them using the controllers.

The controller scaling setup is a little wonky - since you don't point and scale just what the controller is point at. 

You just hold select and move your hands closer/further away to scale everything.

This might mean the "room" moves away from you...

You can hold use your left select to move all the monkeys at the same time.

I wanted to explore rotation - but that involved quaterions and I didn't have time yet.
