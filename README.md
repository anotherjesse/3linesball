# 3 Monkey Inflation

This is based on the three.js example [WebGL Instancing Dynamic](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=instancing#webgl_instancing_dynamic)

This was based on my previous experiment "3monkeys" - this one I wanted to play a bit more with the controller input.

As you press the select button, a monkey balloon is added where the controller is.  It inflates until you release the controller.

There is a bit of simplex noise to make the monkeys heads move a bit
